Dockerize BOTH apps - the Python and the Node app.

1) Create appropriate images for both apps (two separate images!).
HINT: Have a brief look at the app code to configure your images correctly!

docker build .
docker images
docker run -p 3000:3000 feb85d147795
docker run -it 5b67684a0dff
docker ps
docker stop 91387c77db12
docker stop 76e45e329759

docker build -t nodeApp:v1 .
docker build -t pyapp:v1 .

docker run -p 3000:3000 -d -rm --name NodeApp nodeapp:v1
docker stop NodeApp
docker rm NodeApp
docker rmi nodeapp:v1


2) Launch a container for each created image, making sure, 
that the app inside the container works correctly and is usable.

3) Re-create both containers and assign names to both containers.
Use these names to stop and restart both containers.

4) Clean up (remove) all stopped (and running) containers, 
clean up all created images.

5) Re-build the images - this time with names and tags assigned to them.

6) Run new containers based on the re-built images, ensuring that the containers
are removed automatically when stopped.
